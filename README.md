# Project 1

### Project Details

This project was developed as the first project from the Udacity reinforcement learning Nanodeegre. The idea of this agent is to capture all the yellow bananas avoiding the blue ones.

The state space has 37 dimensions, the agent has 4 actions (walk forward, backward, left or right) and it receives +1 point when he get a yellow banana and -1 when he get a blue.

### Getting started

You need to setup your enviroment following the instructions of this link: https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies

Additionally you will need to install numpy and torch for this project. (Use pip install numpy and pip install torch)

### Instructions

In the file Training.ipynb you will find the model training and the test of the model. Additionally in the folder images you will find the graph of the performance of the training and the gif that shows how the model works. Finally, in the file Report.md you will find the description of the algorithm and the report of the results.

To run the training follow the instructions on the Training.ipynb file, the weights of the model will be save in the file checkpoint.pth.
